Salt is a library for creating interactive visualizations to explore big data. Salt summarizes billions of data points across increasingly detailed layers, from an aggregate global view down to every conceivable local subset. Generate interactive geographic heatmaps, cross-plots, or time series with meaningful contextual overlays that enable sense making at every scale.

Salt is optimized to distribute data processing across machine resources, ensuring efficient use of both time and memory.
