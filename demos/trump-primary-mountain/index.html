            <h2> Trump's Primaries </h2>
            <p> This plot shows dots representing 18.8 million tweets about Donald Trump during the first 3 weeks of February while Trump battled rival Republicans in the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.  </p>

            <h3> Climbing up the Mountain Plot</h3>
            <p> What is a mountain plot? </p>
            <p> Every tweet is a dot. As each tweet comes in, it will be plotted based on <i> the time of the tweet</i> and <i>the author id. </i> </p>
            <p> <b> Time. </b> The horizontal axis represents time. The far left side is Feb 1, the far right is Feb 23.</p>
            <p> <b> Author. </b> The vertical axis represents unique authors. The first author that we process starts in the very first row at the bottom. The next tweet processed with a unique user starts another row. Rows keep adding for each user - in this dataset we have 2.75 million unique authors.</p>
            <p> <b> Slope. </b> Because each tweet is added as it comes in, the leading edge of the mountain grows more quickly when more new authors start tweeting about Trump. At the beginning of February it grows very quickly, because there are lots of people tweeting about Trump all the time. About Feb 9, there's a steep bump that corresponds to the New Hampshire primaries and lots of new people talking about Trump. </p>

            <h3> Dots, Stripes and Zoom </h3>
            <p> <b> Bright dots</b> indicate more tweets.
            <p> <b> Bright vertical bands</b> correspond to a time when most of the people are talking about Trump. These correspond to events, such as the GOP debate on
            <a href="#" data-zoom="3", data-x="-70" data-y="-40" data-hashtag="#gopdebate"> Feb. 6</a> and
            <a href="#" data-zoom="3", data-x="10" data-y="-40" data-hashtag="#gopdebate"> Feb. 13</a>. Hit the home button (top left corner) to zoom out again.</p>

            <p> <b> Dark vertical bands</b> correspond to times when very few people are talking about Trump. The
            <a href="#" data-zoom="1", data-x="0" data-y="0">darkest vertical bands</a> are night-time in the US when most people are asleep. </p>

            <p> <b> Dark <i>horizontal</i> bands</b> correspond to a group of people who all joined the conversation at the same time, but really don't talk much about Trump other than their original tweet. There are 12,000 users who pile in on Feb 17. This cohort isn't Trump diehards, they just have a passing interest in
            <a href="#" data-zoom="3", data-x="90" data-y="60" data-hashtag="#littleknowncandidatefacts" >Trump trivia</a>. </p>

            <p> <b> Anomalous patterns </b> stand out because they don't follow the patterns around them. These can be interesting to zoom in and investigate. You can use double-click, mouse-wheel or the +/- buttons top left to zoom in/out. For example, bots can show up as bright smudges or sequences of bright dots that don't match the periodicity of their neighbors. Back in
            <a href="#" data-zoom="5", data-x="-160" data-y="-83.5"> early February </a>
            there's some bright activity among many new posts which we identified as suspect Twitter accounts in our previous post (
            <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.uncharted.software/2016/02/two-days-of-trump-in-iowa/"> Two Days in Iowa</a>).
            </p>

            <h3> Top 10 Topics via Hashtags </h3>
            <p> Over top each square region are the top 10 hashtags. We're collecting tweets (using the Twitter public streaming API) that mention keywords Trump (e.g. DonaldTrump, Trump4President), WakeUpAmerica, and MakeAmericaGreatAgain. Hashtags are useful to see what topic is being discussed.</p>

            <p> <b> Pope Francis </b> became a popular topic  <a href="#" data-zoom="3", data-x="90" data-y="55" data-hashtag="#popefrancis"> starting about Feb 18th</a>. This occurs after the pope makes comments regarding Trump's call for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/18/politics/pope-francis-trump-christian-wall/"> deportation of undocumented immigrants</a>.

            <p> <b> Ben Carson </b> is a popular topic via the hashtag
            <a href="#" data-zoom="3", data-x="70" data-y="-30" data-hashtag="#theonlyoutsider"> #TheOnlyOutsider</a>.
            Zooming in for
            <a href="#" data-zoom="5", data-x="70" data-y="-30" data-hashtag="#theonlyoutsider"> closer inspection</a> shows that there isn't really broad support for this hashtag - it never spreads out vertically. This may indicate that very few accounts are using the hashtag. A quick check over on twitter shows only a single twitter account - <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/wethepeople2017">@wethepeople2017</a> - using this hashtag, but generating tweets every few minutes.</p>

            <p> <b> Opportunists </b> can be similarly isolated. Both #nazi and
            <a href="#" data-zoom="4", data-x="10" data-y="40" data-hashtag="#ebay"> #ebay</a>
            seem to occur together at various places when zoomed in on the plot. Checking twitter seems to show many messages of people selling war memorabilia presumably using popular hashtags to simply increase visibility of their wares. Similarly the tag
            <a href="#" data-zoom="3", data-x="-100" data-y="-80" data-hashtag="#fitn"> #fitn</a> (aka fitness) is rampant throughout the data in early February: likely lots of robots at work but we haven't investigated that subset in any detail.
            </p>

            <p> <b> Competiton </b> can be identified. For example, which other politicians are co-mentioned with Trump?
            Presumably those mentioned most frequently, with the broadest support across all the tweets, are the biggest competitors. You can use <i> browser search</i> (e.g. <i> ctrl-F </i> in your browser) to find any term such as Cruz, Bush, Hillary or Bern: we've made a few shortcuts so you can take a quick look at the macro-level:
            <a href="#" data-zoom="2", data-x="-20" data-y="0" data-hashtag="#cruz">#Cruz</a>,
            <a href="#" data-zoom="2", data-x="-20" data-y="0" data-hashtag="#bush">#Bush</a>,
            <a href="#" data-zoom="2", data-x="-20" data-y="0" data-hashtag="#hillary2016">#Hillary</a>, and
            <a href="#" data-zoom="2", data-x="-20" data-y="0" data-hashtag="#feelthebern">#Bernie</a>. Didn't see Jeb anywhere when you clicked on Bush? Unfortunately, Jeb Bush didn't bubble up to the top anywhere in Trump conversations and he withdrew shortly before the Nevada vote. </p>

            <p> <b> Issues </b> can also be seen among certain groups. For example, the topic
            <a href="#" data-zoom="3", data-x="-70" data-y="-55" data-hashtag="#woman"> #woman</a> occurs repeatedly across a row. Twitter search showns many interrelated topics about Trump's tumultous relationship with women ranging back to the Megyn Kelly incident, other accusations, references to Hillary, and so on.</p>

            <p> <b> Comedy </b> of course, can be uncovered. The hashtag
            <a href="#" data-zoom="3", data-x="-20" data-y="10" data-hashtag="#fodtrumpmovie"> #fodtrumpmovie</a>
            comes up in a few places and is a link to
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/ad38087bac/donald-trump-art-of-the-deal-movie"> Johnny Depp</a> playing Donald Trump in a mockumentary.
            </p>

            <h3> So what? </h3>
            <p> The Twitter conversation is filled with great patterns representing real topics, events, debates; but also robots and interlopers. Regardless of the debates, there's more discussion around Trump and democrats than there is about Trump and the other Republican candidates: Cruz is the only candidate making a presence in the Trump conversation, other than a single Carson supporter.  </p>

            <h3> How'd we do this? </h3>
            <p>The Trump Mountain Plot was built using the open source software
            <a target="_blank" href="http://unchartedsoftware.github.io/salt/"> Uncharted Salt</a>. Salt is a free software library for programmers to assemble massive amounts of data, organize it, mine it, and create interactive displays. We use the library, for example, to analyze GPS data, massive networks, bitcoin, stock markets, product sales, and other big data. Here's a couple other examples:
